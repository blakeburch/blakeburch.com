I've never run my own website before. I used to outsource that work to carrd.co. Now I've finally [created my my own space](../projects/blake-burch-com/index.md).

Here's my public commitment to this space:
- I'm gonna try to make posts as often as I think of them. I've had too many times where a blog post stays in drafts because it's not something that I can "feel proud of".[^1]
- I'm not going to worry about the quality of the posts. Some will be bad. Some will be excellent. Most will just be ok. As long as I get it out there, I provide clarity to myself on how I'm thinking about things. Over time, that results in more refined thoughts.
- I won't use AI to help edit, write, or rewrite my posts. Not even for the proofreading. Everything is straight from my brain to my (key)board. I want to build up my authentic voice. In a world where the [dead internet theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory) is becoming more of a reality, I want to be a bastion.
- I will credit often. If someone influences my way of thinking or greatly helps me out, it's only right that I spread the love. I shouldn't worry about who I'm linking to.
- I'm not going to worry about where a post fits. Should it a blog post or just be a page? Should it live here or on [Bytes Data Action](https://bytesdataaction.substack.com/)? Guess what? I can update an old blog post. I can separate something out to be a page. If I write more, I'll finally be able to tackle the problem I'm worried about having in my mind.

In other words, I'm want to build a non-judgemental haven for my thoughts. Maybe then, looking back, I'll finally have some clarity.

If anything on this site sparks something for you, I'd love for you to reach out. The internet can feel isolating. We should all be using it to bridge gaps and build more authentic connections.

[^1]: I had the idea of forcing anything in drafts that's older than 7 days to get released automatically to help with this problem.
