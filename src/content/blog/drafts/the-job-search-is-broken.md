It's funny how things feel when the roles are reversed. 

Two years ago, I was the employer, spending my time filtering through applicants to find the best fit for my startup.

Now, I'm one month into the playing role of the applicant, seeking the best roles to match my interests and skills.

From what I can tell, both sides suck. Everyone hates the current status of job seeking. But even two years ago, before experiencing it firsthand, I had the sense that the job search was broken. Below is a culmination of thoughts that have been marinating in my mind for a while.

I don't yet know what to do about these thoughts. They're poorly formed. This article is an exercise to structure these ideas in hopes that it brings some internal clarity and resonates with someone. 

Can the problems be fixed? Do we need to rethink job applications? That's for you to decide (and please let me know your thoughts).
