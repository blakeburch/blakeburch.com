For the longest time, I've said that long after Google is gone, its last remains will be Google Maps.[^1]

[^1] Although with the continuous growth and competition against Netflix, I would include YouTube in there as well.

However, some recent experiences have made me start to question whether or not Maps is as untouchable as I thought.

For a maps product to stay relevant to its users, two things have to be true:
1. Information about locations needs to stay up to date and accurate.
2. Navigation instructions need to be trustworthy and relevant.

Its the second one that I'm really struggling with recently.

## The Start of Decline
Roughly 2 years back, I started noticing while driving that Google would continuously show me alternative but slower routes. This seemed like an odd choice, but I chalked it up to a conscious response to driver anxiety. If people complained that they were always worried they were on a slower route, showing them even slower routes would ease their concerns.

## The Current Mess

## Why Use Navigation at all?
Let's be real - I used to be "addicted" to navigation. Prior to this year, I wouldn't go anywhere without pulling my phone out and putting it on its "navigation throne" in my car.[^2]

[^2] Currently the pop sockets car mount.

In January, I spent the entire month exclusively using a flip phone. This device couldn't give me turn-by-turn navigation, so it instead forced my hand. If I knew how to get there already, I would just drive. If I didn't, I would look it up the directions beforehand and memorize the steps meticulously. 

In the end, I never got lost but I learned the roads I was driving on more deeply. What I found was that the act of driving was far more enjoyable when I had to memorize new

So my navigation habits changed. Instead of using it primarily for turn-by-turn directions, I used it to verify the fastest paths. After all, as a man that values time and efficiency, I wouldn't dare drive I-35 if 183 or 290 would shave a few minutes off the final drive time.

### Example 1
My wife and I will often travel to visit family back in the Dallas-Fort Worth area once a quarter. This pretty straight-forward drive takes anywhere from 3 hours to 4.5 hours, depending on the time and holiday.

Now this is an easy drive. The instructions are to stay on I-35 for 200+ miles. But wrecks and slow-downs abound. Sometimes, Google

Often times, if there is a big slow-down on the highway, Google will say that staying on the highway is 5-15 minutes slower than getting off an access road for a few miles. We started gut-checking this by keeping track of a few 18-wheelers and cars to see if we end up ahead of them or behind them when taking the alternatively suggested route (or vice versa).

The end result? It's a mixed bag. Sometimes, taking the alternative road is faster. 

### Example 2
When navigating to a location the other 

### Bonus Story
The other day, after being redirected to the access road, Google took us (and many others) down a farm road of pure gravel to "cut off" the access the road we were currently on.

Thankfully, I wasn't driving. But this decision felt a bit more risky because:
- With all the cars driving on the road, a huge amount of dust was getting kicked up, making it impossible to see
- With the road
- We learned later that there was a car fire on the road, further decreasing visibility.
- The road was only one car-width wide, so there was

### My Theory on What's Happening
From my anecdotal evidence, I believe that somewhere along the way, Google started deciding to "play God" with traffic, rather than simply giving people the data from multiple pathways and allowing them to make a decision themselves. In much the same way that algorithmically driven content has taken over our feeds, algorithmically presented pathways have taken over our navigation.

As a data guy, I've always said this would be a fascinating problem to work on.

## The Future
So what's that solution? I'm not sure.
