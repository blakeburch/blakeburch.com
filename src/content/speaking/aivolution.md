## Overview
Join us for a night of exploration through conversations on AI. Perspectives on AI are swirling, and assumptions on what it all means for people can be conflicting. What does it actually mean to live in the advent of AI? 


With speakers who lead across industries, working on technology and innovation, weâ€™ll be putting humans back into the AI conversation. This event offers you the chance to hear from leaders in AI development and learn about their real-life experiences at the intersection of people-centered organizations and human-like machines. Gen AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence), M/L (machine learning), RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and LLMs (Large Language Models) are all poised to transform the world. Our speakers will discuss how their teams leverage these incredible technologies in a practical, ethical, and safe way.
