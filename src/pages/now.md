# What I'm Up To Now
**Last Updated: 2025-07-31**

Around the end of February I joined a remote company, [Roboflow](https://www.roboflow.com), as an Analytics Engineer. It's been fun to focus on a completely new area of technology for me, computer vision. Now that I know how it works, it feels like every problem in the real world I face, I try discover how it could be solved with Vision AI.

While ramping up at a new job, I decided that I no longer wanted to be running a data meetup, so I handed it over to good hands locally. I'm still on the hunt to fill an event void in the Austin, but I don't think I'm interested in running professional events at the moment.

Work has enabled me to travel much more than previously, which is a nice change of pace. In four months, I've been to Salt Lake City, Chicago, and New York. Part of it is because the company invites employees to hold "lighthouses" in remote locations and gives you the budget to do it. Part of it is because my wife gets a work benefit of 4 remote weeks per year, so we're trying to take advantage of it.

We worked from Chicago and New York for an entire week. During the day, I explored new neighborhoods. During the evening, we went to great restaurants and local shows. In general, my learnings here are that I really like picking a neighborhood and flitting around. Feeling nomadic brings me back to how it felt while I was in Europe for 6 weeks.

I finally had to retire my gaming PC of 8 years and purchase something new. Emotionally, it was hard for me because the gaming PC was a gift from my first boss. However, it's nice to finally be able to play a backlog of great games in Ultra quality.

## What I'm Doing Now
- Playing drums for an improvised musical called [Villain](https://hideouttheatre.com/shows/Villain).
- Still running a [weekly board game meetup](https://www.meetup.com/games-and-grub-austin/) at Pinthouse Brewing in South Austin.
- Continuing with level 6 [improv](https://www.hideouttheatre.com/) classes and starting singing improv.
- Auditioning for local improv shows when the chance arises
- Enjoying some great video games:
  -  Lorelei and the Laser eyes was a great mysterious, escape room. 
  -  Expedition 33 had phenomenal music and the world building engrossed me more than any game in the past few years.

This list feels smaller than last time, which makes me feel bad. But on a whole, I've got consistently planned activities 3 out of 7 days each week. 

## What I'm Thinking About or Exploring
- How can I deepen my knowledge of AI and ML? I know when and how to use it, but I feel lacking when it comes to understanding the underlying tech.
- What are fun niche projects to explore computer vision personally?
- How autonomous can we really make AI agents?
- How can I take my music ideas and make them more concrete through production tools?
- What does it look like to start a band?
- As I get deeper into improv, how do I balance having fun with the self-critique to get better?
- Now that I'm no longer in therapy, how do I find the time to make sure I'm doing ok?
- How can I disconnect from work more? I tend to always default to "founder mode".
- How can I bake in time to explore and learn new things?
- What activities or events are missing from Austin? What can I do about it?
- What can encourage me to write more frequently on personal and technical topics? I say I want to, but history has shown that it's not high on my list.
