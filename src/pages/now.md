# What I'm Doing Now
**Last Updated: 2024-08-12**

After 5 years of running my own company and ultimately shutting down commercial operations, I'm taking some much needed time to reconnect with my curiosity.

Recent time in therapy has made me realize that I've been running on autopilot for a long time. I think I burnt out. Right now, I need to make sure that I'm optimizing for emotions, not obligations. If something makes me happy or interests me, I should run with it. If it doesn't, I should let it go. The important part right now is to be curious, explore, and find that spark again.

This is my way of embracing the [pathless path](https://pathlesspath.com/). I'm open to new roles, projects, and collaborations. If you have something in mind, please reach out!

## What I'm Doing
- Running a [weekly board game meetup](https://www.meetup.com/games-and-grub-austin/) at Pinthouse Brewing in South Austin.
- Running a [monthly data meetup](https://www.meetup.com/austin-data-meetup/) in Austin.
- Preparing to compete in the [World Series of Board Gaming](https://wsbgvegas.com/) in September.


## What I'm Exploring
- Absorbing as much new knowledge about AI and application development as I can.
- Learning Spanish so I can become conversationally fluent.
- Building out this personal website to showcase my work and interests.
- Building new side projects through 2x0 Labs.
- Reading a mix of self-help books and science fiction.
- Writing more frequently on personal and technical topics.
- Volunteering at local charities.
- Engaging with my local community in Austin through networking events, board game nights, and [board walks](https://www.theboardwalks.com/).
- Trying new activities, like [bouldering](https://boulderingproject.com/market/austin-texas/) and [improv](https://www.hideouttheatre.com/).
- Getting back into music through drumming, piano, and song writing. I'm actively seeking out jam sessions.

## What I'm Questioning
- What does the route of solo entrepreneurship look like? 
  - What problems do I want to take a stab at solving?
- How could I offer my skills for consulting work?
- What type of work would I be most interested in doing at other companies?
