# About Me

[Resume](../../public/blake-burch-resume.pdf) / [Personal README](/readme)

## Work

Iâ€™m a pioneer in data strategy and AI, passionate about helping teams automate and act on their data. 

Over the course of 10 years, I've found that no matter the size or the industry, every brand is struggling to drive strategic action and results from their data. As a self-taught technologist, itâ€™s always been my mission to build streamlined workflows and intelligent systems that help companies discover how they can use their overload of data in smarter ways to drive growth every year. My goal is to radically change the way organizations think about using their data and automating their work.

Previously, I was the co-founder and CEO of Shipyard, a data operations platform that helps Data Teams launch, monitor, and share their solutions without worrying about infrastructure. I drove the company's vision, strategy, and product roadmap, helping customers drive value from their data through end-to-end automation.

Before that, I was the Head of Data Services at PMG, directing the agencyâ€™s roadmap and strategy for the Data Engineering, Data Activation, and Data Innovation teams. Over the course of my career, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with and shape the digital strategies of brands like GAP Inc., Sephora, Abercrombie & Fitch, H-E-B Grocery, OpenTable, Travelocity, and Cirque Du Soleil.

## Personal

In my free time, I geek out about tech trends, indie video games & board games. I'm a big fan of live music for funk/jazz/electronic, I play the drums when I can, and enjoy hiking when the Texas heat isn't too bad.

I'm slowly converting from an introvert to an extrovert. As a result, I'm seeking more and more opportunities to go out, meet new people, and build up the local community. That's why I run [weekly board game nights](https://www.meetup.com/games-and-grub-austin/) and [monthly data meetups](https://www.meetup.com/austin-data-meetup/).
